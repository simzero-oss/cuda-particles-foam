# Building

Download OptiX 7.0 for [Linux](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/downloads/7.0.0/linux64). You must be a member of the NVIDIA Developer Program to download OptiX.

The following command will install OptiX in a local folder:

```
./NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.0.0-linux64.sh --include-subdir --skip-license
```

Set the following `OptiX_INSTALL_DIR` variable pointing to the OptiX installation path:

```
export OptiX_INSTALL_DIR=${HOME}/cudaParticlesFoam/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.0.0-linux64
```

and check that the `CUDA_HOME` is set up to your CUDA Toolkit installation path:


```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.1
```

Only OpenFOAM v2106 is currently supported. Install and load OponFOAM's environment before continuing.

Run the following commnad for building the `cudaParticleAdvection` library:

```
make lib
```

And finally build the OpenFOAM solvers:

```
make applications
```

# Running

## Running with native installation

Go to one of the tutorials:

```
cd tutorials/incompressible/cudaParticlesUncoupledFoam
```

and execute:

```
./Allrun
```

## Running with Docker

You need to first configure your machine for using GPUs within Docker containers. Follow this [link](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-enterprise/deployment-guide/dg-docker.html) for instructions.

Once you can run Docker containers with GPUs run:

```
source etc/bashrc
```

Go to one of the tutorials:

```
cd tutorials/incompressible/cudaParticlesUncoupledFoam
```

and execute:

```
runWithDocker ./Allrun
```

You will see the results and logs. The running containers can be checked with `docker ps` and any container stopped with `docker kill CONTAINER_ID`.
